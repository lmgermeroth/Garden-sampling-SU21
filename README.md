# Garden-sampling-SU21
This data is a component of my MS research on monarch butterfly predator communities, and how they vary between different milkweed host plants.
10 backyard garden sampling sites, and at each, 5 stems of three different milkweed species was sampled. Sampling consisted of cataloging everything
we saw on the plants, measuring the height and phenology.
